# Logistic Regression in Python

Let's continue the project using the Wine origin database.

* Go back to the notebook where we practiced classification of wines using kNN
* Divide the database on Training and Test
    * Normalize the database
* Create a Logistic Regression model
* Use Cross Validation to evaluate the behavior of the Training dataset changing the variation of some parameters (Ex.: Solver and multiclass)
* Train the model using the best configuration, and apply this configuration on the Test dataset and evaluate
* Compare the results using the best kNN result.
