# PCA-LDA applied to computer vision

Use the MNIST or LFW database to understand how PCA and LDA could be used as a feature to handwritten character recognition

* Load the LFW database
* Apply PCA evaluating the number of components that are needed
    * Visualize the images associated with the firsts components
    * Exhibit the cumulative variance
    * Compare the input images with the reconstructed images
* Apply LDA on the original data
    * Exhibit the data projection on the linear discriminants
    * Exhibit the cumulative variance rate
* Apply a classifier of your choice on the LDA and PCA obtained features 
* Compare both methods and results
