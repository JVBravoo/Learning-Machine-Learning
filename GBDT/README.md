# GBDT Flight Delays

Let's predict when a flight will be delayed more than 15 minutes
* Use the Train and test dataset from the Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/flight-delays-spring-2018/overview
* Apply Gradient Boosting and reach the best result possible on the Test dataset, following the process that we practiced so far
* Implement and evaluate on the Training dataset
* Normalize the result on the Test dataset and get a 0,5 to 0,72998 on the public Kaggle Leaderboard to get 1 point
* And for results above 0,72998 on the public Kaggle Leaderboard you get 2 points.
