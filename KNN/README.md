Practice: Titanic - kNN

Let's apply kNN to predict the titanic survivors
1. Go back to the data-handling notebook and divide the base in Training and Test
2. Create a classificator kNN choosing a "k" that you wish
3. Train all the numerical features
4. Do the prediction on the Test dataset
5. Evaluate the quality of your model according to the quantity of successes and errors of the predition when is compared to the real value
6. Discover the best "k" executing it numerous times the step 3 to the step 6 using diferent values for "k" and choosing the best evaluation.
