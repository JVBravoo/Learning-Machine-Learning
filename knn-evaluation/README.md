Practice: Titanic - kNN

Let's Evaluate the kNN using the Titanic database.
1. Go back to the KNN file
2. Train the kNN classifier again, but this time using Cross Validation with 5 folds
3. Discover the best value of "k", running the Cross Validation with different values several times.
4. Evaluate your model according to the metrics that were addressed in this section
a. Confusion Matrix, Precision, recall, accuracy and F1-Score
